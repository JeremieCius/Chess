# Chess

## Description

This is a Chess desktop application developed using Java and the JavaFX framework. It allows users to play against one another locally.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase what I've learned during my time in the OMSCS program regarding software development, architecture, and design. 
I used the following classes and books to learn the concepts that I've applied to this project:

### Classes:
 - CS 6300: Software Development Processes
 - CS 6310: Software Architecture and Design
 
### Books:
 - *Clean Code* by Robert Martin
 - *Clean Architecture* by Robert Martin
 - *Code Complete* by Steven McConnell
 - *Design Patterns* by Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides

## Documentation

All the documentation for this project can be found in the documentation directory. 
I recommend reading the planning document to get an idea of what software development process is being used, along with the phases involved in that process.
Before diving into the source code, I would recommend referring to the design document to build an understanding of how these components and classes relate to one another.

## TODO
 - Add an AI bot.
 - Add saving functionality for the game.
 - Add themes to the view component.
 - Add list of moves made to the side of the screen.
 - Allow user to select which piece they'd like to promote a pawn to.
