# Chess

## Description

This is a Chess desktop application developed using Java and the JavaFX framework. 
It allows users to play against one another locally, or against an AI bot (a.k.a. the computer).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase what I've learned during my time in the OMSCS program regarding software development, architecture, and design. 
I used the following classes and books to learn the concepts that I've applied to this project:

### Classes:
 - CS 6300: Software Development Processes
 - CS 6310: Software Architecture and Design
 - CS 6750: Artificial Intelligence
 
### Books:
 - *Clean Code* by Robert Martin
 - *Clean Architecture* by Robert Martin
 - *Code Complete* by Steven McConnell
 - *Design Patterns* by Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
 - *Artificial Intelligence* by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig

## Documentation

All the documentation for this project can be found in the documentation directory. 
I recommend reading the planning document to get an idea of what software development process is being used, along with the phases involved in that process.
Before diving into the source code, I would recommend referring to the design document to build an understanding of how these components and classes relate to one another.

## TODO
 - Update the heuristic function for the bot so that it is updated whenever a move is made.
 - Create bots that use different heuristic functions.
 - Add a screen that allows the user to select which bot they'd like to play against.
 - Export the game to a jar file so that it can be played without downloading the code.
 - Add backgrounds and themes to the user interface.
 - Add animations to moves.
 - Allow the user's piece to move BEFORE the bot starts to make its move.
 - Add saving functionality for the game.
 - Add list of moves made to the side of the screen.
 - Allow user to select which piece they'd like to promote a pawn to.
 - Add a button to reset the state of the game.
 - Move tables from the code to files that can be written to and read from.
