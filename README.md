# Chess

## Description

This is a Chess desktop application developed using Java and the JavaFX framework. 
It allows users to play against one another locally, or against a bot.
The game supports the vast majority of chess rules, such as castling, en passant, promotion, etc.
Additionally, the game supports the use of timers for time limits, and there's a sidebar that shows the algebraic notation for the moves made.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to show that I can build a non-trivial application, and that I can manage and build off of a complex code base.
The courses I've taken so far have only had small projects to work on, and the instructions are usually laid out very clearly.
I wanted to build something of my own that showcases my abilities as a software developer.

I used the following classes and books to learn the concepts that I've applied to this project:

### Classes:
 - CS 6300: Software Development Processes
 - CS 6310: Software Architecture and Design
 - CS 6750: Artificial Intelligence
 
### Books:
 - *Clean Code* by Robert Martin
 - *Clean Architecture* by Robert Martin
 - *Code Complete* by Steven McConnell
 - *Design Patterns* by Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides
 - *Artificial Intelligence* by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig

## Documentation

All the documentation for this project can be found in the documentation directory. 
I recommend reading the planning document to get an idea of what software development process is being used, along with the phases involved in that process.
Before diving into the source code, I would recommend referring to the design document to build an understanding of how these components and classes relate to one another.

## TODO
 - The timer currently goes negative when the computer sleeps. Timer should expire when the computer turns back on.
 - Implement support on Windows OS.
 - Add UCI functionality to support open-source chess bots that can be added to the game.
 - Add pictures to the player's profiles.
 - Add a reset button that resets the game.
 - Highlight the current player's timer.
