# Testing Plan

To test this application, I'll be performing white box testing in the form of unit tests for the methods in the ChessGameInterface with JUnit.
Since GUI frameworks such as JavaFX are notoriously difficult to test, and the user interface for my application is incredibly simple, I won't be performing any integration testing.

## AIInterface Tests
Testing the AIInterface poses some problems. 
Each implementation of the AIInterface will use different techniques for choosing moves, so there's no good way of creating unit tests for the interface since each bot might choose a different move to make for the same state.
Instead of unit testing the interface, I'll be creating a test suite that compares two different implementation of the AIInterface.
Whenever I develop a supposedly superior bot, or improve an existing one, I can have it play against the previous implementations to see if it beats it the majority of the time.
