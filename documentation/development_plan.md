# Software Development Plan

## Description
To catch errors before they become costly to fix, I'll be following a software development process as I build this project.
I anticipate that features will be added throughout the project, so an iterative software development process should work well for this project.

## Iterative Software Development Process Description
In an iterative software development process, software is developed in cycles. 
For each iteration, additional features will be added to the application. 
Each iteration involves sequentially executing each phase of the process.

## Software Development Process Phases
Here are the following phases that I'll be going through for this project:
 - Problem Description
   - The problem description document will be updated to include whatever feature is being added to the system.
   - The user interface design will also be included in the problem description document, since the description is tightly coupled with the user interface.
 - Requirements Gathering
   - The list of functional and non-functional requirements will be updated to include whatever functionality is being brought to the system with the new feature.
   - The requirements document will contain all requirements for the system.
 - Design
   - Once the requirements have been defined, the design of the system will be updated accordingly. 
   - The design of the system can be located in the design document.
   - The design of the system will be composed of structural and behavioral UML documents.
 - Testing Plan
   - After the system has been designed and interfaces have been added, a skeleton of the system will be implemented which contains stubs for the interface.
   - A testing plan will be formed to verify/validate the new system functionality, which will be included in the testing plan document.
   - The tests will then be implemented.
     - Note that the tests are implemented *prior* to the implementation of the system.
     I anticipate needing to refactor to improve performance, so I'll using test-driven development, although I'm not following an agile development process.
 - Implementation
   - The features will be incrementally implemented in each component and sub-component according to the design of the system.
